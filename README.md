# Ray-Casting
If you want to try it out you only need to download the .zip file, extract it and it should run.
I was having problems with the .EXE not working on some computers so I'm sorry if it doesn't work for you.

hold mouse down to show ray paths,  
left/right arrow keys increase ray length,  
up/down arrow keys increase amount of rays,  
"spacebar" places a box,  
"c" clears all boxes,  
holding "r" makes rays reflect of of the walls,  

the sliders and switches do same things :D
