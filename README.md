# Ray-Casting
THE EXE MIGHT NOT WORK XD,  

hold mouse down to show ray paths,  
left/right arrw keys increase ray length,  
up/down arrow keys increase amount of rays,  
"spacebar" places a box,  
"c" clears all boxes,  
holding "r" makes rays reflect of of the walls,  

the sliders and switches do same things :D
