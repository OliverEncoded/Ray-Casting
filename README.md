# Ray-Casting
THE EXE MIGHT NOT WORK XD\n
\n
hold mouse down to show ray paths\n
left/right arrw keys increase ray length\n
up/down arrow keys increase amount of rays\n
"spacebar" places a box
"c" clears all boxes
holding "r" makes rays reflect of of the walls

the sliders and switches do same things :D
