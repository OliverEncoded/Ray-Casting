# Ray-Casting
If you want to try it out you only need to download the .zip file, extract it and it should run.
(If not I'm sorry)

hold mouse down to show ray paths,  
left/right arrow keys increase ray length,  
up/down arrow keys increase amount of rays,  
"spacebar" places a box,  
"c" clears all boxes,  
holding "r" makes rays reflect of of the walls,  

the sliders and switches do same things :D
